C++ BinaryTree
***************
In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. Thanks to it structures BinaryTree allow fast insertion, find and remove operations.

Functions
------------
* insert(V x) - Adding element x to the Binarytree ;
* size() const - Return size of Binarytree;
* print() - Print tree;
* swap(Tree swap, V parent1, V value1, V parent2, V value2) - swapping subtrees roots are defined by arguemnts;
* search_iterative (int x) - Return defined node by argument, if there is no such node return NULL;
* minimum() - Return the smallest value hold by Binarytree;
* maximum() - Return the biggest value hold by BinaryTree;
* depth() - Return depth of BinaryTree;
