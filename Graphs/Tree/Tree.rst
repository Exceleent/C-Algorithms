C++ Tree
***************
In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type (ADT)—or data structure implementing this ADT—that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.

Quick Overview
--------------
In my implementation of a tree I used class Node , Tree and Path. Each node holds his value , pointer to the parent and vector of pointers to his children. We can represent each path in tree by using Path class
